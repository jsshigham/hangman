# Hangman

**_HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React_**

- I built this project to highlight the ability to develop code within TypeScript. The TypeScript logic means that this is a fully functioning Hangman game.
- The game was built using customized CSS and a HTML structure written in JSX for the React App.

## Install and Run

1. npm i
2. npm build
3. npm run dev
